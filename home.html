I'm a 20 year old undergraduate student studying <span class = "highlight">Computer Science</span> currently attending <span class = "highlight">Georgia State</span> University. My curiosity with programming began around my senior year in high school, when my friend (now significant other) wanted me to do his coding music assignment through <a href = "https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/">EarSketch</a>. It wasn't the best song, but it made me realize that I enjoyed programming. I'm not the most confident in my programming skills, but here is where I am in my coding journey so far!</p>
