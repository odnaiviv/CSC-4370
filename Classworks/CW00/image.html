<!-- a short paragraph of text about the image  -->
This is an image of a bean. My friend drew this for me. It was originally supposed to be a drawing of a potato, but I guess something went wrong in translation. Did she misread the prompt? Was my request not clear enough? Who knows! Are we both just two dumb best friends? Probably. But that's okay, I love her art! We'll that potato drawing next time. She wouldn't let me pay for that drawing it only costed $0.01. Oh well. The bean is still really cute though!
