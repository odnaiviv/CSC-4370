(Chorus)<br>
'Cause getting made you want me <br>And hoping made you hurt me <br>
Oh, there must be <br>Something wrong with me <br>
And getting made you want me <br>And hoping made you hurt me <br>
Someone tell me <br>Something comforting

Take what you want, but you're tied by the tooth <br>Wasn't it meant to relieve you? <br>
So suffer the signs that you needed to change <br>Head all the ways you'd been thinking
